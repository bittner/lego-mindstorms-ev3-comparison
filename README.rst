LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Comparison
==============================

This project is meant to complement the comparison made in
`The Difference Between LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition (#31313) and LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 (#45544)`_,
an article by `Laurens Valk`_.

There are two editions of LEGO Mindstorms, LEGO's Robotics Invention System (RIS),
the EV3 Home Edition and the Education Edition.  You may wonder what is the difference
and which one is right for you.  Reviews on Amazon will tell you that the Education
set is meant for schools, with a more robust plastic packaging and shorter, in-class
exercises to go through instead of full-blown projects to be exercised from start to
end that fulfill you as a robot newbie with the Home Edition.

If you one day want to upgrade your set you'll be wondering if you can combine the
two.  The data elaborated in this project may help you with your decision on what
pieces to buy.

Usage
-----

#. ``Lego-Mindstorms-Editions-Comparison.ods``, a LibreOffice Calc spread sheet, lists
   the pieces of all sets combined.  Columns ``H`` and ``K`` tell you which pieces to
   buy if you have either Home Edition + Expansion Set or Education Edition + Expansion
   Set.  You can filter the columns using the "Auto Filter" in the first row.

   The spread sheet document specifically targets the two sections
   *"‘Upgrading’ Elements from Education Edition to Home Edition"* and
   *"‘Upgrading’ Elements from Home Edition to Education Edition"* in Lauren's article.
   Specifically, the document will make the latter section less vague with regards to
   the *"you’ll need to purchase [...] certain Technic building elements"* statement.

   .. note::

      If you can't or don't want to install `LibreOffice`_ here are some free services
      that display or convert the spread sheet: `convert-doc`_ (view), `Zamzar`_ (convert),
      `convertfiles`_ (convert).  Some let you specify the `raw document url`_ directly.
      `Google Docs`_ and `Zoho Docs`_ also import the spread sheet.


#. ``lego-mindstorms-pieces.py`` is a Python3 script to help with calculating and
   ordering required LEGO Mindstorms EV3 spare parts.  It has three commands:

   ``parse``
      Generate the combined list of LEGO pieces from the 3 separate inventory
      lists (the combined list is what the above mentioned spread sheet is made of).
      It takes three file names as an argument.  Output is sent to ``stdout``.
      You can redirect it to a text file using the ``>`` operator on the command
      line.

   ``missing``
      Generate a list of LEGO parts missing in the combination of the Edu Expansion
      set + Home or Edu Core, that only the other (omitted) set would have.
      The output has the format ``part:quantity,...`` and is sent to ``stdout``.
      You can use the result as a shopping list in the ``order`` command.

   ``order``
      Add a list of LEGO parts and their quantity to the 'Shopping Bag' of LEGO's
      customer service platform.  A browser window will be opened, you'll be able
      to watch the browser do what you would normally do by hand, and execution
      will stop after all pieces have been added, so you can review and finalize
      your order.  (This is just to help you save time on entering 60+ pieces
      manually.  Nothing is ordered on your behalf!)

   For full instructions run: ``python3 lego-mindstorms-pieces.py {command} --help``

Documentation, Examples, Hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the `docs folder`_ for sample output of the ``order`` command, and screenshots
of prepared orders at LEGO's customer service platform.

The order process at LEGO is highly automated.  This usually means that orders
with items out of stock, or orders that are too large will not be processed.
LEGO notifies you with an automatic email in such a case.

Your Contribution
-----------------

If you find a typo, an error, a critical mistake or feel there's some enhancement
needed please feel free to `open an issue`_, or even better clone the repository,
apply your changes, and `place a pull request`_.  Your contribution is welcome!

Step by Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make changes to the raw data, e.g. ``raw-data/Brickset-inventory-*.csv``,
in a pull request please also regenerate the combined list and update the Calc
spread sheet as follows::

   $ cd raw-data/
   $ python3 ../lego-mindstorms-pieces.py parse Brickset-* > "Lego Mindstorms EV3 combined list.csv"

Then open ``Lego-Mindstorms-Editions-Comparison.ods`` and copy the contents of
the regenerated ``Lego Mindstorms EV3 combined list.csv`` from a text editor
into the spread sheet as follows:

#. Highlight the first 7 columns and press the ``Del`` key to clear the cells.
#. Place the cursor onto the first left upper cell and press ``Ctrl`` + ``v``.
#. The "Text Import" dialog pops up.  Choose "Unicode" and "Tab" separation.
